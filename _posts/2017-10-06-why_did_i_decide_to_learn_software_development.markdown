Since 2014, I have worked for an international student agency as a data analyst, and at the same time, have majored in computer information systems at college. After graduation, however, I felt like somthing is still missing in me. I wanted to make a website so that I could efficiently get and analyze right information required to be successful in a specific purpose. 

I needed actions. I have finally decided that I am going to learn software development. Unfortunately, I had no idea where to begin. As you know there are a lot of programming languages now. What programing language should I learn? Should I learn web designing too? I am not sure if I will be able to make the decision on my own. I thought I don't have enough money, so I probably don't have many options.

After I did some research, I knew that I would need to join a coding bootcamp. I went to local meetups hosted by several coding bootcamps in NYC to check out. I talked to the every participants and listened to them carefully. Their professionalism and enthusiasm were really impressive. Everyone had a lot of helpful suggestions and even showed me thier projects. After long conversations, I finally decided which one I wanted to join. I started an [online bootcamp prep course](https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-bootcamp-prep-course/) right away, and the experience was amazing. I was so excited when I got admitted to [***Flatiron School***](https://flatironschool.com/). 

Now, I am gradually being fascinated by coding.
